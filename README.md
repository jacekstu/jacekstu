- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacekstu
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building Restful APIs
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a number of things e.g. Building REST API's with Java and Springboot, Javascript and React.js. 
     These are all parts of the personal project I am currently working on. I am also exploring Youtube API (using Python's requests library), which is going to serve
     as a data source for the aforementioned project.
